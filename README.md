This dataset contains simulated data representing various signal modulations, along with their associated SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio) and frequency values. The dataset is designed to facilitate the classification or prediction of modulation types based on given SNR and frequency inputs.

**Contents**

**Modulation Types:** A list of modulation types commonly used in digital communication systems.
**SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio):** Values indicating the ratio of signal power to noise power for each modulation type.
**Frequency:** Carrier frequencies at which the modulations are transmitted or observed.

**Purpose**

The purpose of this dataset is to:
Train machine learning models to classify or predict the modulation type based on given SNR and frequency values.
Explore how different modulation types behave under varying SNR and frequency conditions.
Support research and development in telecommunications, signal processing, and wireless communication systems.

**Dataset Structure**

**Modulation:** Categorical variable representing different modulation types.
**SNR:** Numeric variable indicating the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (in dB).
**Frequency:** Numeric variable representing the carrier frequency (in GHz or similar units).

**Dataset Generation Technique**

Technique for SNR and Frequency Simulation
The SNR and frequency values for each modulation type were simulated using the following technique:

**SNR Simulation:**
SNR values were chosen based on typical operating conditions for each modulation type.
Higher SNR values were assigned to modulations that can handle more noise without significant degradation (e.g., higher-order QAM).
Lower SNR values were assigned to modulations that require clearer signal conditions (e.g., simpler modulations like BPSK or QPSK).
**Frequency Simulation:**
Frequency values were assigned to reflect the range of carrier frequencies used in practical communication systems.
Different frequency values allow for exploring how modulation performance varies across different parts of the spectrum.
Frequencies were chosen to cover a wide range, from low frequencies (e.g., 1 GHz) to higher frequencies (e.g., 80 GHz), depending on the modulation's bandwidth requirements and application scenarios.

**Usage**

**Machine Learning:**
**Training Models:** Use the dataset to train classifiers (e.g., Decision Tree Classifier, Neural Networks) to predict or classify modulation types based on given SNR and frequency inputs.
**Evaluation:** Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports.

**Research and Analysis:**
**Signal Processing:** Analyze how different modulation types perform under different SNR and frequency conditions.
Optimization: Optimize communication systems by understanding the impact of SNR and frequency on modulation selection.
